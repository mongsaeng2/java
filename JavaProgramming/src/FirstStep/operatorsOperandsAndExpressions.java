		/* Operators
		 *	Operators in Java are special symbols that perform specific operations on one, two, or three operands, and then return a result.
		 *  
		 * Operands
		 * 	An operand is a term used to describe any object that is manipulated by an operator.
		 * 	 So if we consider this:
		 * 		int myVar = 15+12;
		 * 		The plus here is the operator, and 15 and 12 are the operands.
		 * 		 Variables used instead of literals can also be operands.
		 * 
		 * Expression
		 * An expression is formed by combining variables, literals, method return values, and operators.
		 * In the statement below, byteValue + shortValue + intValue is the expression.
		 * 		int sumOfThree = byteValue + shortValue + intValue;*/
