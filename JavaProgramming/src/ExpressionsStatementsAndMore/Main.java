		 * Java's Code Units
		 * Writing code is similar to writing a document.
		 * It consists of special hierarchical units, which together form a whole.
		 * These are:
		 * The Expression -An expression computes to a single value.
		 * The Statement -Statements are stand alone units of work.
		 * And Code Blocks -A code block is a set of zero, one, or more statements, usually grouped together in some way to achieve a single goal.*/
