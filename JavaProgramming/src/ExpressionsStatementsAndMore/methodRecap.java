		/* The Method
		 * 
		 * Java's documentation states that:
		 * A method declares executable code that can be invoked, passing a fixed number of values as arguments.
		 * 
		 * Is the method a statement or an expression?
		 * 
		 * Like some of the abbreviated operators we learned about, a method can be a statement or an expression in some instances.
		 * Any method can be executed as a statement.
		 * A method that returns a value can be used as an expression, or as part of any expression.
		 * 
		 * Declaring the Method
		 * 
		 * Declaring Modifiers.
		 * 		ex. public and static
		 * Declaring the return type
		 * 		void is a Java keyword meaning no data is returned from a method.
		 * Alternatively, the return type can be any primitive data type or class.
		 * If a return type is defined, the code block must use at least one return statement,
		 *  returning a value, of the declared type or comparable type.
		 * Declaring the method name.
		 * 		Lower camel case is recommended for method names.
		 * Declaring the method parameters in parentheses.
		 * 		A method is not required to have parameters, so a set of empty parentheses would be declared in that case.
		 * Declaring the method block with opening and closing curly braces.
		 * 		This is also called the method body.
		 * 
		 * Declaring the Parameters
		 * 
		 * Parameters are declared as a list of comma-seperated specifiers, each of which has a parameter type and a parameter name(or identifier).
		 * Parameter order is important when calling the method.
		 * The calling code must pass arguments to the method, with the same or comparable type, and in the same order, as the declaration.
		 * The calling code must pass the same number of arguments, as the number of parameters declared.
		 * When declaring a return type:
		 * 		void is a valid return type, and means no data is returned.
		 * 		Any other return type requires a return statement, in the method code block.
		 *
		 * The Method Signature
		 * 
		 * A method is uniquely defined in a class by its name, and the number and type of parameters that are declared for it.
		 * This is called the method signature.
		 * You can have multiple methods with the same method name, as long as the method signature (meaning the parameters declared) are different.
